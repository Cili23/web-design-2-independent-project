        <img src="images/castle.jpg" alt="A black and white photo of a castle in the distance with a ray of light shining down upon it from the heavens, this castle is allegedly where Grounded Coffee was born" style="width: 100%">
        <p>The story has it a charming young girl was roaming about a Canadian forest, she came upon a secret house. Curious, she wanted to help and old woman bent over a spinning wheel. “Oh! What is this?” she cried as she had never seen it before. She pleaded with the woman, “Please do let me try this as well.” But the minute she touched the needle of the spindle, she fell to the ground into a deep deep sleep. Found by her parents she was taken home, where she would lie for many years. The whole town was sad for this girl. A hundred years later, a skilled barista was hiking through the forest, and he discovered the strange home. While exploring it, he was surprised to find the girl lying fast asleep and he leaned down and poured Grounded Morning Kick coffee into her mouth. Instantly, the spell was lifted, the girl awoke. It was joy and celebration all around as Grounded Coffee was invented.</p>

        <p>FAIRTRADE COFFEE</p>
        <p>Fair trade is an important part of the Full Steam Coffee Company vision to bring back the proud trading tradition of Guysborough harbour. With each bag of coffee sold, people are not only supporting Fairtrade certified coffee producers from around the world, they’re supporting workers in a region of Canada hard hit by the decline of traditional industries. Choosing Full Steam Coffee makes a difference in the lives of hard working people at home and abroad.</p>
